He does not forget to speak about Myanmar issue. Our Myanmar venerable monks act like they don't have anything to do with the Spring Revolution and they do not speak anything that the Myanmar people are being killed and violented by the SAC. It is very sad,he said.Source:Myanmar Pressphoto Agency,Photo:Pope Francis (Vatican News)",
